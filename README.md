# ccob-wb

This repository contains the analysis software for the Camera Calibration Optical Bench - Wide Beam projector (CCOB-WB). The CCOB-WB aims at producing a (relative) composite flat field of the LSST focal plane (without the optics) at a precision of a few per mil. 

The CCOB-WB consists in 6 LED, emitting light at  wavelength characteristic of the 6 LSST filters, mounted on a integrating sphere. The outgoing beam, 3-4 cm wide, can illuminate any part fo the focal plane. The measurement is performed in two steps:

- First, the beam must be reconstructed at the per mil level. This is done by choosing a bunch of reference pixels and scanning those pixels with the beam over a fine grid. This allows to define a beam model. 
- Second, each CCD of the focal plane is illuminated by the beam, in each wavelength. Several exposures are taken to reach the required S/N level. The corresponding average image divided by the beam model computed at step 1, will be provide a synthetic flat field of that CCD. 

Stability during the scan is monitored/ensured by a control photodiode mounted on the sphere: for each exposure, the signal is divided by the photodiode reading. The CCOB-WB does not allow for an absolute measurement but will provide a accurate and precise meaurement of the relative response of the LSSTCam focal plane.

## Requirements

`ccob-wb` requires Python version 3.6 or later and depends on:

- [astropy](https://www.astropy.org/) 
- [eotest](https://github.com/lsst-camera-dh/eotest)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [scipy](http://www.scipy.org/)
- [dm-stack](https://pipelines.lsst.io/) (LSST analysis pipeline)


## Running the analysis

At the moment, the analysis is not automated and the various steps need to be run "by hand". 

- The configuration files `beam_config.yaml` and `analysis_config.yaml` contain information to run step 1 and 2 (see above) respectively. They mainly consist in the path to access the relevant data. Depending on how data acquisition proceeded, the data may be spread over various directories. 
- `ccob_beam.py` reconstructs the beam model from the scan over the bunch of reference pixels. This produces a pickle file containing the beam object, that is then used in step 2.
- `ccob_qe_analysis_BOT.py` proceeds to step 2 and creates, for each CCD (and position of the CCOB), a FITS files containing the synthetic flat. 

Some evolution of the software is likely, depending on the (final) Run 5 dataset.
